database normalization
1. a set of logical rules and processes to follow for data modeling
2. organizing a database
3. goals of normalization
a. remove redundant data
b. achieve a design which is a good representation of the real world

tables are connected by relationships

key techniques:
1. column splitting
2. column extraction
3. query merging
4. query appending

split criteria
1. delimiter
2. number of characters
3. position in string
4. lower vs upper casting
5. digit vs non-digit

column extraction
1. keep distinct rows, shrinking total data model size and reducing redundancy

query appending
1. combining contents of two or more tables into a single table
2. match rows based on column names, adding null for missing columns

equivalent to union all

types of join:
inner join
left outer join
right outer join
full outer join

Creating a lookup table
1. duplicate the table
2. keep the 2017 naics codes and meaning of naics code columns
3. remove duplicates for 2017 naics codes

appending tables
1. append as new (three or more tables)


duplicate column
extract before delimiter

duplicate column
extract last for characters
extract before delimiter
