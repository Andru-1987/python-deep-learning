how does filtering work?

1. exclude rows not meeting a key metric

2. high confidence level and high conviction level

# Preview the rules DataFrame using the .head() method
print(rules.head())

# Select the subset of rules with antecedent support greater than 0.05
rules = rules[rules['antecedent support'] > 0.05]

# Select the subset of rules with a consequent support greater than 0.02
rules = rules[rules['consequent support'] > 0.02]

# Select the subset of rules with a conviction greater than 1.01
rules = rules[rules['conviction'] > 1.01]

# Print remaining rules
print(rules)

# Set the lift threshold to 1.5
rules = rules[rules['lift'] > 1.5]

# Set the conviction threshold to 1.0
rules = rules[rules['conviction']>=1]

# Set the threshold for Zhang's rule to 0.65
rules = rules[rules['zhang']>=0.65]

# Print rule
print(rules[['antecedents','consequents']])
