profit margin %
Gross Profit Margin = Gross Profit / SalesValue


fixed costs are costs independent of units produced

variable costs per unit are costs incurred per unit produced.

variable costs are incurred only if the unit is produced

if your core product is not profitable how will you pay admin or other expenses or taxes or dividends

The gross profit can be used to calculate the break even point.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Break even point

Break even is where total cost and total revenue are equal.

break_even = fixed_costs / (sales price - variable_costs)


>>>> sample  >>> forecasting sales 
T-Z has launched a new range of T-Shirts linked to a celebrity meme for 40 USD per T-Shirt. They have excess stock of Celebshirt1 on their shelves, and in expectation of the release of Celebshirt2 in February, they have announced a 40% discount on Celebshirt1 in February.
For this exercise, prices are in USD, and unit amounts are total units sold in the respective month. The following variables have been defined for you:
sales_price = 40
units_january = 500
units_february = 700
The January sales only include sales of Celebshirt1. 
The February sales include sales of Celebshirt1 and Celebshirt2, at a ratio of 45:55.


# Set variables units sold and sales price of the T-shirts (basic and custom)

salesprice_basic = 15
salesprice_custom = 25

# Calculate the combined sales price taking into account the sales mix
average_sales_price = (salesprice_basic * 0.6) + (salesprice_custom * .4)

# Calculate the total sales for next month

Assets are economic resource and it can be used to make money

Income Sales are record and also recorded as a credit under the Debtors item in the balance sheet as an accounts receivable.

If we sell our credit we can buy our credit as well.  Operating expense are recorded on the income statment and also recorded as a liability creditors on the balance sheet.
