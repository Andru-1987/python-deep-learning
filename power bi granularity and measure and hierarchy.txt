2. smaller cache sizes and faster refresh time

measures
1. fields or combinations of fields which can be aggregated or calculated

when you import data into powerbi it is automatically aggregated as sum

Hierarchies (allow users to drill down into data dimensions)
1. natural hierarchies

b. year->month->day

2. artificial hierarchies
