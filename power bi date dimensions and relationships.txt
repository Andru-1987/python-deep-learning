creating date dimensions
1. match fiscal year with calendar year
2. slice by quarter, month, and week

time dimensions handle times of the day:
hour, minute, and second

time dimensions tend to be much less common than date dimensions



dax
month_year = Calendar(date(1950,1,1), today())

relationships allow you to link tables in power bi
1. propagate filter across tables
2. allow for cross-table calculations

autodetect based on column names

relationship keys

1. relationship are based on keys
a. one or more columns which guarantee a row is unique

2. two types of keys
a. natural key: existing column
b. surrogate key: artificial column

power bi requires single column relationships

composite key: a key made up of at least two columns


cardinality
1. a measure of the relationship between rows of two given tables

a. one to many 1 and *
b. many to one * and 1
c. one to one 1 and 1
d. many to many * and *
