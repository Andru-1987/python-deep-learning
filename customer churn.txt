churn is when a customer ends a relationship with the company

non-contractual churn (consumer loyalty)
involuntary churn (expiration or non payment)

Customer
1. Lack of usage
2. Poor service
3. Better price

Domain/industry knowledge

Telco churn dataset.

telecom features
1. voice mail
2. international calling
3. cost for the service
4. customer usage
5. customer churn indicator

churn is defined as the customer cancelling their cellular plan at a given point in time.

print(telco['Churn'].value_counts())

>>> Sample using groupby
print(telco.groupby(['Churn']).count())
print(telco.groupby(['Churn']).std())
print(telco.groupby('State')['Churn'].value_counts())

understand how your variables are distributed

import seaborn as sns

sns.distplot(telco['Account_Length')

sns.boxplot(x='Churn', y='Account_Length', data=telco,sym="")
plt.show()


#The bell curve means that the data is normally distributed. This means that the data
can be simulated by random sampling to increase the accurracy of the prediction

sns.boxplot(x="Churn", y='Account_length',data=telco)
plt.show()

#The line in the middle represents the median
#The colored boxes represent the middle 50% of each group

#The floating points represent outliers
sym="" removes the outliers


sns.boxplot(x='Churn', y='Account_Length', data=telco,sym="", hue='StreamingMovies')
plt.show()

>>>Sample
Day_Mins
Eve_Mins
Night_Mins
Intl_Mins

# Import matplotlib and seaborn
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Visualize the distribution of 'Day_Mins'

sns.distplot(telco['Day_Mins'])
# Display the plot
plt.show()


#If the data was not normal distribute, you would apply a feature transformation

#In such cases, the extreme values could be identified and removed in order to make the distribution more Gaussian. These extreme values are often called outliers

#Taking the square root and the logarithm of the observation in order to make the distribution normal belongs to a class of transforms called power transforms.


>>>Sample

# Import matplotlib and seaborn
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Create the box plot
sns.boxplot(x = 'Churn',
          y = 'CustServ_Calls',
          data = telco)

# Display the plot
plt.show()

test decision trees and logistic regression models (compare the models)

churn definition depends on company
1. churn happens when a customer stops buying or engaging with the company
2. The business context could be contractual or non-contractual
