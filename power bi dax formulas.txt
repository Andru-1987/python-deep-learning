introduction to context
1. enables dynamic analysis where results of a formula change to reflect the selected data
2. There are 3 types of context: row, filter, and query
3. row context is the current row
4. calculated column is values from all columns within the current row


Measures:
1. can apply when using iterator functions which compute calculations row by row
2. iterator functions can be identified by an X after the function name SUMX()

SUMX(<table>,<expression>)

SUMX(Sales, Sales[Price]+(Sales[Price] * Salex[Tax]))


Filter Context
1. Filter context is a set of filters that have been applied before the calculation is carried out

Applied in several ways:
1. attributes in row/column
2. slicer
3. filter pane
4. calculated measure


CALCULATE(<expression>[,<filter1> [,<filter2>[,...]]])

expression: a measure or calculation to be evaluated.  Must return a single value.


filters:
1. filters need to evaluate as a table
2. Filters should not clash with one another

CALCULATE( SUM(Sales), Sales[Region]="EMEA")
