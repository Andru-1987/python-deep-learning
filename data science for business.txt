b. gives individuals control over their personal data
c. regulates how long data can be stored
d. mandates appropriate anonymization
e. disclose data collection and gain consent

2. customer data

3. logistics data
4. financial transactions

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>solicited data

create marketing collateral
de-risk decision making
monitor quality

surveys
customer reviews
in-app questionaires
focus groups

types of solicited data
qualitative: conversations, open-end questions
quantative: multiple choice, rating scale (graph or chart)

stated preference
1. hypothetical
2. subjective

revealed preference
1. actions
2. purchase decisions

best practices
1. be specific about the question
2. avoid loaded language
3. calibrate your survey  (calibrate) (compare interest in product with another product)
4. every question you ask will help you take a decisive action

>>>>>>>>> collecting additional data

a. apis (application programming interface)
(twitter, wikipedia, yahoo, google maps)

b. public records
(data.gov, data.europa.eu)

c. mechanical turk
(asking humans to complete a task that we eventual plan on computerizing)
(aws mturk)
(label customer reviews, extract text from a form, highlight keys words in a sentence)

>>>>>>>>> data storage and retrieval

1. store the company data across many different computers
a. cluster on premise
2. cloud 
a. pay another company to store data


types of data storage
1. email, text, video and audio, web pages, social media

stored in a document database use nosql

tabular and relational databases use sql

storing the data is like building a library

>>>>>>>>>Dashboards

how analysis explore the data using dashboards

timeseries tracks change over time

with stack bars you can easily recognize trends
1. categorical comparison (bar chart)
2. comparison between the categories is over the same time period

key indicator
1. highlighting a single number

powerbi tableau looker

specify a use case


>>>>>>>>>ad hoc analysis

ad hoc request is a data request that is not repeated weekly or daily and it can come from many places

include context
be specific
include a priority level and due date


ticketing system:
trello, jira, asana

>>>>>>>>>> a/b testing

control and variation

1. picking a metric to track
2. calculating a sample size
3. running the experiment
4. checking for significance

sample size needs to be large enough so the selection is not due to random chance

test sensitivity tells how small of chance in the test we are able to detect

high sensitivity detects small differences
low sensitivity detects large differences


sensitivity that is meanful for the business model
how does the change affect profits

statistical significance then the results are not due to random chance

what if the results aren't significant
* difference is smaller than the threshold we chose
* running our test longer won't help


Increasing the minimum detectable difference makes our test less sensitive to changes in the purchase rate.

As the overall chance of observing a successful purchase becomes more likely, it becomes easier to detect a difference in purchase rate.

As the baseline conversion increases, it becomes easier to reach significance and the sample size decreases. The less sensitive our tests, the smaller the sample size we need. 


>>>>>>>>>machine learning

making predictions from data
ml (labels and features)
1. recommendation systems
2. email subject optimization
3. churn prediction

customer: 1. likely to cancel or subscribe

features: age, gender, date of last purchase, household dollars, profession, number of kids


>>>>>> clustering

divide the data into categories
divide customers into segments
anomaly detection
unsupervised learning
1. uses only features

analyze the behavior of individual segments

customer flight segmentation
1. number of flights
2. percent international
3. advance planning
4. percent business class


>>>>>>>>>>>>>deep learning
1. Is the training data complex
2. Do we have a very large amount of training data
3. Does the model need to be predictive or explanatory
