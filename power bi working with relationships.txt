filter direction
1. all relationships have a cross filter direction
2. determines the direction that filters will propogate.
3. from dimension to fact

single direction filters
1. filter in one direction

bi-directional
1. filter in both directions

bi directional filters cannot allow for two separate paths between two tables

role playing dimensions
1. sometimes we need to create multiple relationships between tables.


create role playing dimensions
1. dimensions that can filter related facts differently
2. typically implemented as views of the date dimension


measure name = calculate(measure function, USERELATIONSHIP(dimension key column, fact key column)


Number of employees by year founded=
calculate(average('Establishment Survey'[Number of Employees],Userelationship('Time'[Year],'Establishment Survey'[Year Founded]))
