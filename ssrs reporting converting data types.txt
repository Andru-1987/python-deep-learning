focusing on data cleaning and validation

data can be messy in several ways
1. inconsistent data types
a. string
b. numerical
c. date

2. avg can only be run on numerical data types

3. upper for string

4. datediff for dates

5. data types must be consistent when combining tables

cast(field as type)


>>>>

select column_name, data_type
from information_schema.columns
where table_name='countries'


-- Pull column_name & data_type from the columns table
SELECT 
	column_name,
    data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
-- Filter for the table 'country_stats'
WHERE table_name = 'country_stats';

SELECT AVG(cast(pop_in_millions as float)) AS avg_population
FROM country_stats;


>>>>>

SELECT 
	year,
    -- Pull decade, decade_truncate, and the world's gdp
    DATE_PART('decade',CAST(year as date)) AS decade,
    DATE_TRUNC('decade',CAST(year as date)) AS decade_truncated,
    SUM(gdp) AS world_gdp
FROM country_stats
-- Group and order by year in descending order
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year DESC;
