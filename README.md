python deep learning notebooks

I am using python to visualize data and learn from it.

3. I applied gradient boost to predict death trends for three states (time series covid 19.ipynb)
2. I applied linear regression and gradient boost to predict the morality rate trends (time series with machine learning.ipynb)
1. I applied deep learning to predict mpg based in hp, weight, displacement, and gears
