a vacation analogy
1. hotel gives you two payment options
a. one where you pay at a lower rate with no chance of refund
b. one where you pay a higher rates with a cancelation of 20% of the room rate

How to decide between options
1. what determines your decision?
a. chance of negative shock: illness, travel disruption, weather
2. Loss associated with shock: amount or conditional amount
3. Desire to avoid shock: personal feeling
a. risk tolerance

Risk exposure: probability of loss x loss measure
1. Loss Measure VaR

suppose the chance of canceling your vacation due to illiness is 10%  P(illiness)=0.10

the non-refundable hotel cost is 500 euro

Var at 90% 

100- P(illness)=90% is 500 euro

total non-refundable hotel cost is 500 

euro
refundable hotel cost is 550 euro

VaR at 90% confidence level: 20% cancellation fee x 550=110 euro

>>>>>>>The risk exposure in the non refundable case

P(illness) * VaR90= 0.10 x 500 euro=50 euro


>>>>>> The risk exposure in the partial refundable case

P(illness) * VaR90=0.10 x110 euro = 11 Euro

the difference if 50 euro - 11 euro = 39 euro

total price difference between the two offers 550 euro - 500 euro = 50 euro

50 euro is more than 39 euro

risk-neutral : only expected values matter

risk-averse : uncertainty itself carries a cost

enterprise/institutional risk management: preferences as risk appetite

individual investors: preferences as risk tolerance

>>>>>

risk exposure depends upon loss distribution (probability of loss)

more generally: continuous loss distribution
a. normal distribution good for large samples


students t-distribution
a. has fatter tails than normal distribution for small samples
b. similar to portfolio returns/losses
c. as the sample size grows, t converges to the normal distribution


from scipy.stats import t

params = t.fit(portfolio_losses)

VaR_95 = t.ppf(0.95, *params)


>>>> degrees of freedom
1. degrees of freedom are the number of independent observations

2. the degrees of freedom affect the shape of the distribution

x=np.linspace(-3,3,100)

plt.plot(x, t.pdf(x,df=2))
plt.plot(x, t.pdf(x,df=5))
plt.plot(x, t.pdf(x,df=30))


>>>>> t-distribution

# Import the Student's t-distribution
from scipy.stats import t

# Create rolling window parameter list
mu = losses.rolling(30).mean()
sigma = losses.rolling(30).std()
rolling_parameters = [(29, mu[i], s) for i,s in enumerate(sigma)]

# Compute the 99% VaR array using the rolling window parameters
VaR_99 = np.array( [ t.ppf(0.99, *params) 
                    for params in rolling_parameters ] )

# Plot the minimum risk exposure over the 2005-2010 time period
plt.plot(losses.index, 0.01 * VaR_99 * 100000)
plt.show()


Because the confidence level was fixed at 99%, we kept the probability of loss at 1%


>>>>>> Conditional CVaR

# Fit the Student's t distribution to crisis losses
p = t.fit(crisis_losses)

# Compute the VaR_99 for the fitted distribution
VaR_99 = t.ppf(0.99, *p)

# Use the fitted parameters and VaR_99 to compute CVaR_99
tail_loss = t.expect(lambda y: y, args = (p[0],), loc = p[1], scale = p[2], lb = VaR_99 )
CVaR_99 = (1 / (1 - 0.99)) * tail_loss
print(CVaR_99)

CVaR is the expected value of loss given a minimum loss threshold.
