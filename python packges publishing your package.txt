Python Package Index

2. anyone can upload packages
3. you should upload your package as soon as it might be useful

when you upload your package to PyPI, you upload a package distribution
1. A distribution package is a bundled version of your package which is ready to be installed

a. source distributions: a distribution package which is mostly your source code
b. wheel distribution - a distribution package which has been processed to make it faster to install

python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

a. sdist= source distribution
b. bdist_wheel = wheel distribution

this will create a dist directory with wheel and source files inside

upload your distribution to pypi

twine upload dist/*

upload your distributions to TestPyPI
twine upload -r testpypi dist/*


pip install mysklearn
