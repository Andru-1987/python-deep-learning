how to resolve performance problems

areas where things can go wrong
1. data import
2.querying the database with directquery
3. displaying visuals
4. calculated versus computed columns
5. inefficient relationships
a. many to many relationships
b. bi directional cross filtering


optimizing data
1. import date
2. remove unnecessary rows and columns
3. choose correct data types
a. numeric data takes less space
b. casting and aggregating data is slower
4. group and summarize data
a. store less data on disk
b. get to aggregate results faster

direct query
1. limit parallel queries
2. relational database advice
a. write efficient sql queries
b. use appropriate indexes
c. get right columns and rows

computed columns get calculated at import time

removing bi-directional filtering using filter measures

1. Create a filter measure in DAX

slicer_MYFactable = int(not isempty('My Fact Table'))

2. we want cases where there are records in the fact table
a. returns 1 if at least one value in the fact table
b. returns 0 if no values in the fact table

Add a visual filter to the slicer and set where Slicer_MyFactTable=1
