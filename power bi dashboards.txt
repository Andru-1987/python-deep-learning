dashboards
1. tells us about critical business or operational metrics, often in real time

2. Single pane of glass

3. The norm for powerbi


pixel-perfect reports
1. provides more detailed information on business or operational metrics, usually delayed

2. called paginated reports in power bi


dashboard audience
1. who is your intended audience
2. how will they use your dashboard
3. what actions do you want them to take as a result of looking at your dashboard
4. are you showing the right measures in the right way

at bat (AB)
hit (H)

batting average H/AB

a batting average of 300 is great

Walk (BB)
Hit by Pitch (HBP)
sacrifice fly (SF)

On-Base percentage (OBP)
H+BB+HBP
/
AB+BB+HBP+SF

->350 good 4000 is great



Put out (PO) ->defense causes an out
Assist (A) -> a throw to a defender who then puts out the player
Error (E) ->failed to make an out

>>>>>> invoke an emotional response from the audience

Lets look at two emotions: happiness and angry

1. happy when everything looks fine
a. I do not need to perform any action (
2. angry when threshholds are crossed
a. now i need to act in response to this issue


baseball defensive positions
1. pitcher (P)
2. catcher (c)
3. first baseman (1b)
4. second baseman (2b)

putout is when a defender directly makes an out
assist is when two defenders work together to make an out

two outs on a play is called a double play

if the defender makes a mistake it is called an error

hitting for power
Single (1b)
double (2b)
triple (3b)
home run (HR)


slugging percentage
SLG=(1B+2*2B+3*3B+4*HR)/AB

or
H=1B+2B+3B+4B

SLG = (H+2B+2*3B+3*HR)/AB


Slugging Percentage SLG = Divide(( Batting[Hits H]+Batting[2B]+2*Batting[3B]+3*Batting[Home Run HR]),Batting[At Bat AB])
