what determines the cost of the electric bill?
1. how much electricy is used during the course of a billing cycle.
2. the wholesale price your utility pays for electricity varies from day to day
a. wholesale price is based on demand for electricity and the cost of fuel for generators
b. natural gas and coal are the largest sources of electricity production 
c. predictors of price: total demand, natural gas prices, hour of day, wind generation output, coal prices, month, day of week
d. Megawatt-hours (MWh) are a common unit of measure for both electricity generation capacity and demand
e. the Random Forest approach was better able to capture the cyclical (i.e., non-linear) nature of our time series data, which fluctuates depending on the hour of the day, day of the week, and month of the year
