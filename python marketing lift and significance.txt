two sample T test

T-distribution : 
1. determines that the samples occurred by chance
2. uses the mean and sample variance

The T test produces a P value

1. T-statistic of 1.96 is typically statistically significant at the 95% level
2. depending on the context of the test, you may be comfortable with a lower or high level of statistical signficance

a P value of 0.05 translates to statistical signficance of 95% level
