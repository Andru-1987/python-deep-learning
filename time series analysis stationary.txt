strong stationary : entire distribution of data is time-invariant.  (The distribution does not depend on time)

weak stationary: mean, variance, and autocorrelation are time-invariant (the mean, variance, and autocorrelation do not depend on time)

Autocorrelation is a mathematical representation of the degree of similarity between a given time series and a lagged version of itself over successive time intervals

if the data is non-stationary it becomes difficult to model

if parameters vary with time, too many parameters to estimate

can only estimate a parsimonious model with a few parameters

random walk is an example of nonstationary series.


many stationary series can be made non-stationary

plot.plot(SPY)  #SP500 is a non stationary random walk

plot.plot(SPY.diff()))  with the first difference


plot.plot(HRB) #not stationary
plot.plot(HRB.diff(4))  #seasonal difference


>>>>amazon revenue to stationary

plt.plot(np.log(AMZN).diff(4))


>>>>>>>> HR block  seasonal made stationary

# Import the plot_acf module from statsmodels
from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf

# Seasonally adjust quarterly earnings
HRBsa = HRB.diff(4)

# Print the first 10 rows of the seasonally adjusted series
print(HRBsa.head(10))

# Drop the NaN data in the first four rows
HRBsa = HRBsa.dropna()

# Plot the autocorrelation function of the seasonally adjusted series
plot_acf(HRBsa)
plt.show()
