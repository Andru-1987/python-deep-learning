a/b testing is a way to compare two ideas in the real world and see which one performs better

1. provides accurate answers quickly
2. allows rapid iteration of ideas
3. establishs causual relationships

randomly assign users to two different groups

expose:
group 1 to the current product rules
group 2 to a product that test the hypothesis

pick whichever performs better according to a set of kpi

users+ideas -> A/B test

1. testing the impact of drugs
2. incentivizing spending
3. drive user growth


1. understand users - key performance indicators
2. identify trends - exploratory data analysis
3. optimizing performance
4. data driven decisions


a/b test: measure impact of changes on KPIs
KPI - metrics important to an organization

obtaining the kpi requires experience, domain knowledge, and exploratory data analysis
1. what is important to a business
