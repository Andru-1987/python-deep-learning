paging is splitting data into equal chunks

separating data into quartiles or thirds (top middle 33%, and bottom thirds) to judge performance

ntile(n) splits data into n approximately equal pages

with disciplines as 
(
select distinct Discipline from Summer_Medals)

select Discipline, ntile(15) over() as page
from Disciplines
order by Page asc 


with Country_Medals as (
select
Country, count(*) as medals
from Summer_Medals
Group by Country),

select Country, Medals,
NTILES(3) over (order by Medals desc) as Third
from Country_Medals;

WITH Events AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT Event
  FROM Summer_Medals)
  
SELECT
  --- Split up the distinct events into 111 unique groups
  Event,
  Ntile(111) OVER (ORDER BY Event ASC) AS Page
FROM Events
ORDER BY Event ASC;

  SELECT Athlete, COUNT(*) AS Medals

  GROUP BY Athlete
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1)
