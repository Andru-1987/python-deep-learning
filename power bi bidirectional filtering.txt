
create two slicers
Naics code=>Industry group
Geography -> Geographic Area Name

Cross filter direction: for one to many relationships the cross filter direction is always one side, and optionally from the many side (bi-directional)

for one to one relationships, the cross filter is always from both tables.

The slicers will reduce according to the linkage of the tables.

instead of copying table several times.  The appropriate technique is to use the userelationship() function.

Related Number of employees=calculate(Sum('Summary Statistics Double NAICS'[Number of employees],userelationship('Summary Statistics Double NAICS'[NAICS Code Related],'NAICS Code'[2017 NAICS]))
